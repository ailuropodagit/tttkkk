                        the features that are offered through the Site. You are responsible for maintaining the 
                        confidentiality of your account password. You are also responsible for all activities that 
                        occur in connection with your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized

                        Your account is for your personal, non-commercial use only. In creating it, we ask that you 
                        provide complete and accurate information about yourself to bolster your credibility as a
                        contributor to the Site. You may not impersonate someone else (e.g., adopt the identity of a

                        provide an email address other than your own, or create multiple accounts. If you use a pseudonym,
                        take care to note that others may still be able to identify you if, for example, you include
                        identifying information in your reviews, use the same account information on other sites, or
                        allow other sites to share information about you with Yelp. Please read our Privacy Policy for 
                        more information.
