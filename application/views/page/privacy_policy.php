        We, and third parties with whom we partner, may use cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts, local shared objects such
        as HTML5 and Flash (sometimes called "flash cookies"), advertising identifiers (including mobile identifiers such 
        as Apple’s IDFA or Google’s Advertising ID) and similar technology ("Cookies") in connection with your use of the
        Service, third party websites, and mobile applications. Cookies may have unique identifiers, and reside, among other
        places, on your computer or mobile device, in emails we send to you, and on our web pages. Cookies may transmit information 
        about you and your use of the Service, such as your browser type, search preferences, IP address, data relating to 
        advertisements that have been displayed to you or that you have clicked on, and the date and time of your use. Cookies
        may be persistent or stored only during an individual session.

                websites, or to tell us if you have recently clicked on an ad.

        <b>Managing Cookies:</b> It may be possible to disable some (but not all) Cookies through your device or browser settings,
        but doing so may affect the functionality of the Service. The method for disabling Cookies may vary by device and
        browser, but can usually be found in preferences or security settings. For example, iOS and Android devices each
        have settings which are designed to limit forms of ad tracking. Please note that changing any of these settings
        does not prevent the display of all advertisements to you.
