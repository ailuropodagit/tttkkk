                    <b>Advertisers get ads. Period.</b>

                    There’s no amount of money a business can pay to manipulate their reviews or rating and Yelp doesn’t skew
                    things in favor of advertisers or against businesses that don’t.

                    An independent academic study (not commissioned or paid for by Yelp) found that advertising plays no role in 
                    how reviews are recommended on Yelp. Or as this in-depth profile of Yelp in BuzzFeed puts it: “Harvard Business
                    School professor Michael Luca has co-authored a new study that effectively debunks the extortion theory.”

                    Conspiracy theorists have had their day in court on more than one occasion, but courts have repeatedly dismissed 
                    their lawsuits claiming that ratings and reviews on Yelp are somehow tied to advertising. You can find the media 
                    reports here: PC World, WSJ, HuffPost, CNET, LA Times.

                    If advertisers could control their reviews, then you’d expect them all to have perfect 5-star ratings
                    on Yelp. Spoiler alert: They don’t. To test this, do a few searches in broad categories in your area - 
                    maybe for a dentist, mattress, or locksmith. You’ll find ads for businesses with all sorts of star ratings.
                    Conversely, you’ll find thousands of businesses in organic results with great ratings that don’t pay Yelp
                    a dime, and we’re fine with that.

                    Still don’t believe us? Feel free to do your own version of a simple Google test like this [site:yelp.com/biz 
                    “Yelp advertiser” AND “rude staff”] by inserting your own negative phrases in the last set of quotation marks.
                    The words "Yelp advertiser" only appear on pages of advertisers, which begs the question: if these Yelp advertisers
                    get a special “Delete” button for negative reviews, why in the world aren’t they using it? (Hint: because it 
                    doesn’t exist.)
